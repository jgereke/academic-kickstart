I'm a research fellow at the the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES). My current research focuses on intergroup relations, migration and discrimination and cooperative behavior in modern societies.

Other research projects examine biased beliefs and superstitions in migration decision-making, the socio-economic foundations and consequences of trust and risk attitudes, and the link between physical attractiveness and immigrants'  integration outcomes. My research draws on a range of  experimental and quasi-experimental methods, including original lab-in-the-field, survey, and field experiments in Italy, Germany, the United States and Thailand.

Prior to joining the MZES, I held a postdoctoral position at the Carlo F. Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics and Public Policy at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. I hold a Ph.D. in Social and Political Sciences from the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.
