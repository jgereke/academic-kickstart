  description = "Does local exposure to refugees affect right-wing support and anti-immigrant sentiments? This paper studies the allocation of refugees to the rural hinterlands of Eastern Germany during the refugee crisis of 2015. Similar to non-urban regions elsewhere, the area has seen a major shift towards the political right, despite minimal previous exposure to foreigners. We draw on electoral records and original data collected among 1,320 German citizens from 236 municipalities, half of which received refugees. Two conditions allow for causal identification: a policy allocating refugees following strict administrative rules, and a matching procedure rendering treated and control municipalities statistically indistinguishable. Our survey and behavioral measures confirm the presence of widespread anti-immigrant sentiments, but these are entirely unaffected by the presence of refugees in respondents’ hometowns. If anything, local exposure to refugees served as a ‘reality check’, pulling both right- and left-leaning individuals more towards the center."

  description = "Experimental economics has moved beyond the traditional focus on market mechanisms and the ‘invisible hand’ by applying sociological and socio-psychological knowledge in the study of rationality, markets, and efficiency. This knowledge includes social preferences, social norms and cross-cultural variation in motivations. In turn, the renewed interest in causation, social mechanisms and middle-range theories in sociology has led to a renaissance of research employing experimental methods. This includes laboratory experiments, but also a wide range of field experiments with diverse samples and settings. By focusing on a set of research topics that have proven to be of substantive interest to both disciplines - cooperation in social dilemmas, trust and trustworthiness, and social norms - this review aims to highlight innovative interdisciplinary research that connects experimental economics with experimental sociology. We conclude that experimental economics and experimental sociology can still learn much from each other, thus providing economists and sociologists with an opportunity to collaborate and advance our knowledge on a range of underexplored topics of interest to both disciplines.
